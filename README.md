# IMDB-sentiment-analysis
The purpose of the project is trying to come up with a model that can classify reviews of movies to positive and negative, then it rates the total movie reviews and gives score to the movie based on the model that developed.
The project was developed on jupyter notebook with tensorflow and the web server program was developed on python with Flask.

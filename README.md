# IMDB-sentiment-analysis
Unfortunately I lost all the code to that project, I am working on developing it again. 

The purpose of the project is trying to come up with a model that can classify reviews of movies to positive and negative, then it rates the total movie reviews and gives score to the movie based on the model that developed.
The project was developed on jupyter notebook with tensorflow and the web server program was developed on python with Flask.

Thanks to "Tech With Tim" youtube channel for providing inspiration for the project website template.<br>
**Note:** The model file is to large. If you want to run the model on your own computer you will need to run the notebook first and then run the python server.
